Project Description:

From where we left off in Assignment 1, we started our syntax analysis using
using the tokens and the template given in the GLSL specification sheet.

To make our tasks simplified, we tried to follow the trees provided so that we
exactly know how each rules connects.

Before Writing The Rules:
First we looked into the header files and added all the necessary fields to the
unions before writing any rules.
Then, as we started writing rules, we started including non-terminal types to
ensure program doesn’t throw any unnecessary warning or errors.
Next, to make our task easier, we followed the GLSL specifications and created a
template of all the rules to make our transition easier to code. Although we were
bit hesitant, but the sole purpose of doing that was to follow exactly what the instruction told us.

Writing Rules:
As we started writing the rules, we tried to get the identifier, operators and
other fundamental things done before moving to writing statement rules - as they’re
very complex. We covered all the the operators highlighted in the specifications,
as well as identifier and other declarations. We tried to follow the specifications
as closely as possible, but for the sake of time and simplification we had to merge
some of the rules together. And in some case create our own rules.
Along the process we applied test driven development, by running a python script
provided by one of the students on pizza against test cases against the provided
binary and our binary. We used this as a guide to complete as many of the
specifications as we could.
